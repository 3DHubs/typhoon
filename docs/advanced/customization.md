# Customization

To customize clusters in ways that aren't supported by input variables, fork the repo and make changes to the Terraform module. Stay tuned for improvements to this strategy since it is beneficial to stay close to this upstream.

To customize lower-level Kubernetes control plane bootstrapping, see the [poseidon/bootkube-terraform](https://github.com/poseidon/bootkube-terraform) Terraform module.
