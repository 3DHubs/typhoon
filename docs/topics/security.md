# Security

Typhoon aims to be minimal and secure. We're running it ourselves after all.

## OpenPGP

Typhoon uses upstream container images and binaries. We do not currently distribute materials of our own.

## Disclosures

If you find security issues, please see [security disclosures](/topics/security). If the issue lies in upstream Kubernetes, please inform upstream Kubernetes as well.
